# Good files

This is a personal repo of some simple code in C written in order to learn basics.
The ultimate goal is to build a matrix calculator that can be operated from terminal with a makefile and what not.

## Installation

Any system with C and compiler is capable of running these files ad hoc.

## Usage

As of 24.02.2024:
- A calculator that can perform basic operations on two numbers.
- A matrix "writer" capable of creating two 3x3 matrices in separate file (a stepping stone in the ultimate goal).

## Contributing

This is for personal learning purposes.

## Licence

Files are under DWUW licence (Do What U Want).
