# Good files

This is a personal repo of some simple code in C written in order to learn basics.
The ultimate goal is to build a matrix calculator that can be operated from terminal with a makefile and what not.

## Installation

Runs in terminal with the right compiler.

## Usage

As of 22.03.2024:
- A calculator that can perform basic operations on two numbers.
- A matrix "writer" capable of creating two 3x3 matrices in separate file (a stepping stone in the ultimate goal).
- A joke
- A program to find most frequent words in a text file
